    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn recent decades, the online shopping has played an increasing role in people’s daily lives, the convenience and time saving of it has greatly improved our lifestyle. When we shopping online, an interesting phenomenon is that the recommendation section at the main page keep displaying the products that similar to the products we have previously viewed or searched in the searching engine. Sometimes, as an example of myself, I did not buy it directly but add to cart for later instead, but at other time, I was attracted by the recommended products and buy it immediately. These behaviors is driving firms trying to enhance customer experience and conversion rate to increasingly value knowledge of the elements influencing e-commerce buying behavior. With the machine learning course we have learned this semester, although its algorithms can precisely forecast the user’s behavior, it is also vital to know why a model produce particular predictions.\nIn this project, we intends to mimic an e-commerce environment and investigate how user-level characteristics, such as browsing time, number of categories viewed, number of products in cart, affect the probability of completing a purchase. We not only basically generate the predictive classifier but also evaluate the model interpretability using both linear(Logistic Regression) and non-linear(Random Forest) models. For each model, we create the three different plots to visualize the feature importance and understand the activity of our models. Our plots types are:\n\nAdded Variable Plots\nPartial Dependence Plots\nLIME plots\n\nThese tools allow us to further explore which features are important for two models and how consistent the interpretations are across local and global perspectives. With our shopping behavior scenario, they allow us to gain the information about the features that influence the final purchase behavior and the consistence of influential feature of two models. By perform the comparison between the result of two models, we can also gain information about the accuracy and difference about the two models.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nInstead of downloading the dataset from website or from the packages, we replicate a dataset that reflects usual user interactions on an online shopping platform in a controlled and interpretable environment to investigate e-commerce buying behavior. The dataset contains both binary and continuous variables often used in consumer behaviour modelling; each observation relates to one user session. From time spent on the website to interaction history, we developed six explanatory variables and one binary response variable (buy) to capture various facets of a user’s purchasing session. The final purchase result is a binary indicator, it equals 1 if the user bought the product and 0 otherwise.",
