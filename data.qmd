# Data

## Description
Instead of downloading the dataset from website or from the packages, we replicate a dataset that reflects usual user interactions on an online shopping platform in a controlled and interpretable environment to investigate e-commerce buying behavior. The dataset contains both binary and continuous variables often used in consumer behaviour modelling; each observation relates to one user session. From time spent on the website to interaction history, we developed six explanatory variables and one binary response variable (purchase) to capture various facets of a user's purchasing session. The final purchase result is a binary indicator, it equals 1 if the user bought the product and 0 otherwise.


## Feature Explanation
Specifically, the dataset includes the following predictor variables:

  - `browsing_time`(numeric): Time (in hours) spent browsing the platform during the session.
  - `category_count`(integer): Number of different product categories the user interacted with.
  - `clicked_ad`(binary): Whether the user clicked on any product advertisement (1 = yeas, 0 = no).
  - `items_in_cart`(integer): Number of items added to the shopping cart.
  - `device_type`(categorical): Device used for browsing, coded as “desktop” or “mobile”.
  - `previous_purchase`(binary): Whether the user previously made the purchase on the platform (1 = yeas, 0 = no).
  
The response variable is also a binary variable, showing whether the customer buy the product or not:

  - `purchase`(binary): Whether the user complete a purchase during the session (1 = yeas, 0 = no).
  

## Data simulation
To simulate these data, we created the six characteristics and the response variable using frequently used statistical distributions to replicate the dataset. 

  - `browsing_time`: drawn from a Normal distribution with a mean = 3 and standard deviation = 1.
  - `category_count`: sampled from a Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 4$.
  - `clicked_ad`: generated from a Bernoulli distribution with a success probability of 0.35($p = 0.35$).
  - `items_in_cart`: sampled from a Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$.
  - `device_type`: created as a binary variable with $60%$ probability of being a desktop user and $40%$ being the mobile user.
  - `previous_purchase`: generated froma Bernoulli distribution with $p = 0.25$.
  - `purchase`: derived using a logistic model with a linear combination of the predictors and additional Gaussian noise for realism.

Here is our simulated dataset:
```{r}
set.seed(5293)
n <- 500

# Generate the features for the dataset
browsing_time <- rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1)               # hours
category_count <- rpois(n, lambda = 4)                    # integer count
clicked_ad <- rbinom(n, 1, prob = 0.35)                   # binary
items_in_cart <- rpois(n, lambda = 2)                     # integer count
device_type <- rbinom(n, 1, prob = 0.6)                   # 0 = desktop, 1 = mobile
previous_purchases <- rbinom(n, 1, prob = 0.25)           # binary
noise <- rnorm(n, 0, 0.5)

# Simulate outcome
logit <- -1 + 
  0.8 * browsing_time - 
  0.6 * category_count + 
  1.2 * clicked_ad + 
  0.5 * items_in_cart + 
  0.4 * previous_purchases +
  0.3 * device_type +
  noise

p <- 1 / (1 + exp(-logit))
purchase <- rbinom(n, 1, p)

# Assemble data frame
sim_data <- data.frame(
  browsing_time,
  category_count,
  clicked_ad,
  items_in_cart,
  device_type = factor(device_type, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("desktop", "mobile")),
  previous_purchases,
  purchase
)

head(sim_data)
